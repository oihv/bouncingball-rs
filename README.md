A simple ASCII bouncing ball simulator (following Tsoding) written on a weekend. Zero dependency, all in terminal.

# Notable features:
- Two line compression system to mitigate TTY rendering for text. (Done by Tsoding)
- Simple collision for left-right wall and ground.

Credits to Tsoding (https://github.com/tsoding/) for the inspiration of writing this fun program from scratch.
